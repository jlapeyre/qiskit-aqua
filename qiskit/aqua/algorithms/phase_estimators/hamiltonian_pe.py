    This class is nearly the same as `PhaseEstimator` differing only in that the input in that class
    is a unitary operator, whereas here is is a Hermitian operator from which a unitary will be
    obtained by scaling and exponentiating. The scaling is performed in order to prevent the phases
    from wrapping around `2pi`. This class uses and works together with `PhaseEstimationScale`
    manage scaling the Hamiltonian and the phases that are obtained by the QPE algorithm. This
    includes setting, or computing a bound on the eigenvalues of the operator, using this bound to
    obtaine a scale factor, scaling the operator, and shifting and scaling the measured phases to
    recover the eigenvalues.

    Note that, although we speak of "evolving" the state according the the Hamiltonian, in the
    present algorithm, we are not actually considering time evolution. Rather, the role of time is
    played by the scaling factor, which is chosen to best extract the eigenvalues of the
    Hamiltonian.
